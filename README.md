# FlowBench
FlowBench is a workflow workbench application, designed to help developers make custom modifications to their workflow processess.

Similar to how architects use CAD software to make changes to blueprints, this software lets you define and then manipulate your development workflow process. There's a reason buildings aren't made based on verbal discussions or just a page of text (even if ithat page is a "living document" / on a wiki / a series of documents). You could call it Computer-Aided Workflows as a genre of software.
